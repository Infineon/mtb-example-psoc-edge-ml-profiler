# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Machine learning profiler

This code example demonstrates how to use the ModusToolbox&trade; Machine Learning (ModusToolbox&trade;-ML) development flow on PSOC&trade; Edge MCU, where you can have a pre-trained neural network (NN) model, which can be profiled and validated on the PC and target device.

Import a pre-trained model using the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool, create an embedded, optimized version of this model, and validate the performance on the PC. After this, the validation data files can be integrated with this code example or streamed to the device (default option), so you can run the same validation data and profile performance when the ML model is deployed on the PSOC&trade; Edge MCU. You can also select where to deploy and run the model:
- **High-performance domain:** Uses the Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-M55 and the Ethos-U55 processor
- **Low-power domain:** Uses the Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-M33 and the NNLITE processor

For details about the ModusToolbox&trade; machine learning solution, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; for Machine Learning](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/modustoolbox-machine-learning/).

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)

> **Note** IAR is not supported by the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM) library.

## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`) – Default value of `TARGET`
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

By default, the *Makefile* for the Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-M55 and Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-M33 uses a model that comes with the code example. The pre-trained NN model is located in the *pretrained_models* folder. You can use the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator to link to this file or load another model file and generate C files for the target device.

- **proj_cm55/Makefile:** Uses the RESNET model located at *proj_cm55/pretrained_models/*
- **proj_cm33_ns/Makefile:** Uses the SMALL_MLP_MNIST model located at *proj_cm33_ns/pretrained_models/*

By default, the output file location is set to *mtb_ml_gen*. The project name is set to *TEST_MODEL*. If you change any of these default settings, edit the following *Makefile* parameters of this code example:

 Makefile parameter | Description
 :--------   | :--------
 `NN_TYPE=`  | Defines the input data format and NN weights. It can be `float`, `int16x8`, or `int8x8`. The integer types indicate (input/output) x (weights) quantization
 `NN_MODEL_NAME=` | Defines the name of the model. The name comes from the *project name* defined in the ML Configurator tool. Do not use quotes when changing the name of the model
 `NN_MODEL_FOLDER=` | Sets the name where the model files will be placed. The name comes from the *output file location* defined in the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool
 `NN_INFERENCE_ENGINE` | Defines the inference engine to run. It has two options: `tflm` or `tflm_less`. Note that Ethos-U55 does not support the `tflm_less` option
 `NN_NPU_ENABLE` | Enables the NNLITE NPU. Only available for the CM33 project
 `NN_RNN_MODEL` | Defines if the profiled model is RNN type

<br>

There are two *design.mtbml* files in this code example:
- *proj_cm55/design.mtbml*
- *proj_cm33_ns/design.mtbml*

Choose one design and open it with the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool. To validate the given model with the tool, click the **Validate in Desktop** tab. By default, the project uses the testing data stored in the file located at *sample_data/* folder. If *Enable model quantization* is checked, the project uses calibration data stored in the file also located at *sample_data/* folder.

Alternatively, you can use a random dataset structure to validate the model. You can click the **Validate** button to initiate the validation. Note that this will generate the regression data files that can be stored in the internal memory of the target device. Therefore, limit the sample count to '100' in the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool. Note that validation in the desktop is not available for Ethos-U55.

You can also stream the test data to the device by clicking the **Validate on Target**. In this scheme, the regression data files are not stored in the internal memory, so you can work with a larger dataset. It uses the UART to stream the data. Note that validation in the target is always available; regardless of the target platform.

By default, this code example sets the UART baudrate at 1 Mbps when streaming data to the device. ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool has the option to change the baudrate under the *Validation on Target* tab. Ensure that the baudrate configured in the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator matches the value passed as an argument for the `app_retarget_io_init()` function in the *main.c* file.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. In *common.mk*, set the `ML_PROFILER_CPU` to `cm33` or `cm55`. You must profile only the model for the given core. If using local regression data, set the `ML_VALIDATION_SOURCE` to `local`. Then, open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. If using regression local data, confirm that "Neural Network Profiler", model information, profiling data, and accuracy results are printed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 2. Terminal output using local validation**

   ![](images/ml-local-validation.png)

4. If using streaming regression data (the default option), open the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool. Open the *design.mtbml* file from the core under test and click **Validate on Target**. Select the KitProg COM port (ensure that no other software has the COM port open) and check the *Quantization* that matches the **NN_TYPE** set in the Makefile. Click **Validate**

   **Figure 3. ML Configurator tool using stream validation on target**

   ![](images/ml-stream-validation.png)

5. If using the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool, the results of the validation are printed on the tool's console. Log files for the profiling are stored in the following files (located at *`NN_MODEL_FOLDER`/info_target/* folder):

   - **device_log.txt:** All messages exchanged between the ML Configurator tool and the device
   - **profiler_info_log.txt:** profile information, including CPU and NPU cycles

   You can choose the type of profiling/debugging data to be printed by setting the `PROFILE_CONFIGURATION` macro in *main.c* file

   - **MTB_ML_PROFILE_DISABLE:** Disables profiling feature
   - **MTB_ML_PROFILE_ENABLE_MODEL:** Prints general CPU and/or NPU cycles profiling
   - **MTB_ML_LOG_ENABLE_MODEL_LOG:** Prints model output values

   > **Note:** Depending on the chosen quantization, validation results return a failure if the accuracy is less than or equal to 98%
